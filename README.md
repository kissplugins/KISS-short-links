A simple, no-fuss plugin to display and copy the default WordPress short link for any post, page, or custom post type.  

== Description ==  

Keep It Simple! The "KISS short links" plugin embraces this philosophy by doing one thing perfectly: it makes it effortless to access the default WordPress short link (`/?p=ID`).  

In the post editor, right below the main permalink, this plugin displays the short link along with a clean, one-click copy icon. This saves you the hassle of publishing a post and manually constructing the URL just to get the short link. It's perfect for when you need a stable, clean URL that will never change, even if the post's slug does.  

**Features:**  
* Displays the post's short link (`yourdomain.com/?p=123`) in the editor.
* Works for all post types (posts, pages, and CPTs).
* Features a single-click clipboard icon to copy the link instantly.
* Extremely lightweight and built with WordPress best practices.
* No settings page, no branding, no fluffâ€”it just works.

== Installation ==  

1.  **From your WordPress dashboard (easiest way):**  
    * Navigate to 'Plugins' > 'Add New'.
    * Click 'Upload Plugin'.
    * Choose the `kiss-short-links.zip` file you downloaded and click 'Install Now'.
    * Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

2.  **Via FTP:**  
    * Unzip the `kiss-short-links.zip` file.
    * Upload the `kiss-short-links` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server.
    * Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Once activated, edit any post or page to see the KISS Short Link below the title and permalink.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, it works seamlessly with both editors.

**What post types are supported?**
It supports all public post types, including regular Posts, Pages, and any Custom Post Types (CPTs) you have registered.
